            <h2>Latest Perfumes Posts</h2>
            <p>‘Perfume is the invisible, unforgettable, fashionable accessory that announces your arrival and prolongs your departure,’ quipped Coco Chanel. This quotation by the late grande dame of fashion encapsulates the importance of a perfume to its wearer. Every year, purveyors of perfume strive to create more ambitious and unique fragrances, which will linger in hearts, minds (and noses) long after the wearer has left the room. But amongst the huge number of luxury perfumes on offer, some are a cut above the rest, both in terms of the quality of their fragrance and in terms of price point.

            These ultra luxury perfumes are like artworks, both in terms of their intricate play of notes and their high calibre packaging and bottles. Top of the list of most expensive fragrances is Shumukh, created by Nabeel. Launched in 2019, this musky scent made with rose and sandalwood costs more than €1.5 million euros. Its bottle, made with 3,500 diamonds and pearls, 2.5kg of 18 karat gold and 5.9kg of silver, is a sparkling objet d’art and the armour a truly exceptional perfume.</p>

                                So precious is the bottle that just ten of them were made. Seven were snapped up by private collectors and the remaining three tour the world as part of Clive Christian’s special collection.
                                
                                As for the perfume itself, all Clive Christian’s fans know that he considers his No.1 to be the best of the best and he calls it “the perfume of his heart”. There is no greater tribute.</h3>

So I am wearing some of finest cloves in my possession: Diptyque’s L’Eau de L’Eau; Caron Bellodgia parfum, and Floris’s gorgeously carnationesque Malmaison, the latter two adulterated by me to make them more spicy: two drops of ylang ylang, black pepper and clove essential oil in each, and boo ha we have what we want (I know it sounds heretical, but the Bellodgia is just too musky otherwise, and the Malmaison too polite and trust me, my sharper remix works nicely).</h3>
